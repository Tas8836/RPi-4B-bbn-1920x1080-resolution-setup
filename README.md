# Resolution Setup for 1920x1080

This repository contains the logic to set the screen resolution to **1920x1080** at login using Budgie Desktop's **autostart feature**.
On my raspberry pi 4b running BareBoat Necessities Operating System. I had trouble with evertime I connected to a difference screen I would have to adjust something. This seems to have fixed it.
